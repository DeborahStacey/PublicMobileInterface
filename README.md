* UPDATE 2016-10-21

- Now using Ignite template; we've had to remove a couple of pages temporarily due to time constraints; will be re-added for next build
  - Blame midterms
- `npm install` will need to be run before buildding
- If running the `react-native run-android` causes an error, run `cd android && ./gradlew clean`; then cd back to the root project directory and run the first command again
- If you still get an error, run `chmod u+x android/gradlew` and try again
